                <p> Norman is a hairless cat from rural Arkansas, but make no mistake he is a house cat through and through. That is to say he is a pampered spooiled monster. He spends his time napping under a blanket, harrassing his dog brothers, and begging for food.</p>

                <p> Poco is a Xoloitzcuitle or more commonly known as a mexican hairless dog. Poco had an unfortunate start to life in Mexico where he was starved and mistreated. He was rescued and brought to the U.S. where he found his humans and cat brother. He is a world wide traveler, now living in France, and we can't confirm but we are pretty sure he is tri-lingual.</p>

                <p> Harry is the grandpa of the group. He is a little French Poodle in constant need of attention. Before he joined us he lived with an old woman who unfortunately had to give him up due to poor health. He fits perfectly into our pack and loves to give sloppy grandpa kisses.</p>
